# osu-stuff
this is my version of azuelle's repo (https://github.com/Azuelle/osuStuff) containing difficulty icons for each star rating, for beatmap descriptions and the such.

## diffs
to put a diff in your description, use this bbcode, replacing the 0.00 with your star rating **between 0.00 and 9.00**:

`[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Purplegaze/osu-stuff/main/diffs/std/0.00.png[/img]`

you'll need the exact hex code if you want to colour the following text the same as the diff icon.
i don't know html so instead i just put all the hex codes for each star rating on a sheet.
