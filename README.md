# osu-stuff
this is my version of azuelle's repo (https://github.com/Azuelle/osuStuff) containing difficulty icons for each star rating, for beatmap descriptions and the such.

full credit to her for the initial idea, as well as the std and taiko template icons.

## diffs
to put a diff in your description, use this bbcode, replacing "0.00" with your star rating **between 0.00 and 9.00**:

`[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Purplegaze/osu-stuff/main/diffs/std/0.00.png[/img]`    
you can replace "std" with "taiko", "catch", or "mania".

you'll need the exact hex code if you want to colour the following text the same as the diff icon.

to get the hex code just look on this sheet, you can also easily copy the image bbcode from there:
